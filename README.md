<h1>Requirements:</h1>
1. Data aggregation and storage: Implement a backend system that fetches articles
   from selected data sources (choose at least 3 from the provided list) and stores
   them locally in a database. Ensure that the data is regularly updated from the live
   data sources. <br>
2. API endpoints: Create API endpoints for the frontend application to interact with the
   backend. These endpoints should allow the frontend to retrieve articles based on
   search queries, filtering criteria (date, category, source), and user preferences
   (selected sources, categories, authors).<br>
   Data sources that can be used (choose at least 3)
1. NewsAPI: This is a comprehensive API that allows developers to access articles

   blogs. The API provides access to articles in various languages and categories, and
   it supports search and filtering.<br>
2. OpenNews: This API provides access to a wide range of news content from various
   sources, including newspapers, magazines, and blogs. It allows developers to
   retrieve articles based on keywords, categories, and sources.<br>
3. NewsCred: The NewsCred API provides access to a wide range of news content

   newspaper, one of the most respected news sources in the world. The API provides
   access to articles in various categories and supports search and filtering.

   <h2>Challenge Guidelines</h2><br>
1. The output expected from this challenge is a Backend project using PHP Laravel.<br>
2. Implement data fetching and storage mechanisms for the selected data sources.
   Ensure that the data is regularly updated from the live data sources.<br>
3. Create API endpoints that allow the frontend application to interact with the backend
   and retrieve articles based on search queries, filtering criteria, and user
   preferences.<br>
4. Incorporate best practices of software development, including DRY (Don't Repeat
   Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and SOLID (Single responsibility, Openclosed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, Dependency inversion) principles.<br>
   <p>Please note that this challenge focuses exclusively on the Backend development aspect
   of the news aggregator website, and user authentication has been removed from the
   requirements.
